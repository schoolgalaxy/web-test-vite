      "content": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. It is played on courses consisting of either 9 or 18 holes, with the objective being to complete the course with the lowest number of strokes. Golf is unique among ball games as the course is the main obstacle rather than an opposing team."
