      "content": "Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The objective is to ground the ball on the opponent's court while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. Players use their hands to bat the ball back and forth over the net, with each team allowed up to three touches before sending the ball over. Points are scored when the ball hits the ground or when the opposing team commits a fault."
